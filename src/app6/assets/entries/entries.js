          The first week as an encorian must be one of the most difficult but at
          the same time exciting things I can write about. For me, this means
          the start of a new challenge, since I’m at the start of my
          professional career, so these few days have been like a roller coaster
          inside my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuesday was the most exciting day, we got to meet the people we were
          talking to through emails and text messages at the kickoff meeting.
          Although we didn’t do too much, we were told about how we would be
          working through the week, all the information about our accounts, and
          how to set up the devices we got sent. Last but not least one of the
          things I really enjoyed was meeting all my colleagues and hearing
          their reasons for entering Encora. At the end of the day, we got our
          first assignments, which consisted of two essays and one online
          assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second day was the busiest one and the one I was expecting the
          most since the topics seemed really interesting to me. We started with
          the Safe Spaces talk, which let us know about the different
          departments where we are free to ask for help depending on the
          situation if we feel lost, or need something. This is one of the
          reasons I picked Encora, since after reading all the information about
          the company, it is noticeable that the thing they care about the most
          is the wellness of their workers. Then we got the Training Class,
          which was a small talk about the perks and benefits we have with our
          personal email.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the day, I joined the Art of Feedback talk. In this talk
          I felt I became someone else at the of it. This is where I learned the
          most. The talk was about how important it is to always express what
          you think and what you feel with your coworkers and clients in the
          most polite way possible, so things can go smoothly and there are no
          misunderstandings. Moreover, I learnt the real meaning of empathy, and
          how to distinguish it from sympathy. I always struggle differentiating
          these two words since I am someone who is direct when I speak, and I
          always say everything I think is wrong, as well as knowing how to
          recognize when I’m in the wrong. This talk really helped me
          pinpointing how I can improve to better understand people and what
          they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thursday was the most important day as we discussed security issues
          and working environments at Encora. In the “do and not to do” class we
          discussed the most common ways people get scammed or get their
          information stolen and how to prevent it. The topics were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Social Engineering:</b> Is the way people manage social change
            and regulate the way someone will behave in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Malware:</b> Malicious software that can take control over your
            computer and know every move you make.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ransomware:</b> Malicious software which will block all access to
            your computer until a fee is paid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phishing:</b> Scam using known trademarks to make you think you
            are being contacted by a well-known company{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Spear Phishing:</b> Personalized phishing where the scammer
            already has sensitive information about you
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trojans/Macros:</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the end, we were instructed on the actions we must take when we are
          presented in a situation like these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, we got to know the methodologies followed at Encora with
          the “Agile” class. The topics weren't broadly explained although we
          got to know that Agile methodologies are used, such as Scrum, Xtreme
          Programming, KanBan and ScrumBan.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, we started with a big surprise. We got to use our English
          in the entire meeting called “What is Operational Communication
          anyway...”, I was really shy at first but as the meeting progressed, I
          felt really confident at answering some of the questions that were
          asked. I felt motivated to know that we have a space and people that
          will be focused on spend time with us so we can improve our English as
          better as we can, it is something I never heard of in other places so
          I’m looking forward to be asking for help every time I don’t feel
          confident enough with my skills. Then, we joined the orientation
          class, which basically was an explanation of how life at Encora is,
          the perks of working here and a small talk about the speaker’s
          experience at the company, which made me even more excited at being
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, it was the checkout for the first week. I
          appreciated the format of the presentation as I felt as if I was
          talking to a member of my family. They asked questions normally other
          people wouldn’t care to know, but I felt heard, felt at home. It was
          really fun to hear everyone’s experiences and fun things they did
          throughout the week so I’m really happy and enthusiastic about
          participating next week too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, I completed the online training assessments on the
          weekend. Since they were the same topics we discussed throughout the
          week, this was an amazing opportunity to reinforce the knowledge I
          acquired.

          My second week as an Encora Apprentice was a little bit more relaxed,
          although that doesn’t mean it was easy. We got to use a programming
          learning tool called HyperSkill. There, we got asked to complete a
          Java BackEnd Developer path to get used to this programming language.
          I already had experience with other programming languages such as
          Python, JavaScript and C++, so this has been a really nice refresher
          for me since I got the opportunity to re-learn concepts I forgot over
          the years, and got the opportunity to reassure knowledge that was not
          100% clear before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform is really easy to use as it is really intuitive. The way
          it works is by projects, so you can practice everything right after
          you learn it. All the summaries and explanations are clear, and what I
          liked the most is that you get to test the knowledge gained after
          every lecture in an enjoyable way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were asked to work on a cinema project, which basically was divided
          into 5 sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Learning how to print, and basic concepts about the programming
            language.
          </li>
          <li>Syntax.</li>
          <li>Arrays and Loops.</li>
          <li>
            Functional programming (which I learned are called methods in Java).
          </li>
          <li>Error handling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The project asked us to write a program which would let us construct
          our cinema by printing the available seats on the console using
          multidimensional arrays, pricing them according to their position, and
          letting the user pick their seats. At last, we were asked to handle
          every action that would make the program crash, like user made
          mistakes, or wrong calculations that would happen within our code.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from the HyperSkill platform, I attended a couple of meetings
          throughout the week. The first one was “Communication” which I could
          describe as a complement to the meet we had on the next day called
          “Client Introduction”. Both were very similar as they let us
          comprehend that letting people know what you are thinking, what you
          understand from them is the most important part as a developer. You
          always need to have clear all the requirements from your client, and
          not be shy to ask “silly” questions, as sometimes not asking and not
          talking on spot, would lead to a complete loss in the future. Both
          meetings gave us recommendations on how to broaden our communications
          capabilities, and how and who to ask if we encounter problems with
          someone.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The second meeting was the continuing part of “Do and what not to do”
          talk. Here I could learn who to ask if sometime I have the need to ask
          for tools, licenses or software about security such as VPN’s,
          subscriptions to any webpage, etc. In addition, I met people that I
          could ask for help whenever I make a mistake or something that could
          harm the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last meeting of the week was “Opportunity Seagulls”. Here we were
          introduced to the marketing team, which gave us a broad talk about how
          we can contribute to the company by forwarding every potential client
          we meet in our daily life, work meetings, work travels and such to the
          marketing department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, this week was a transformation time for me. I can
          start by talking about Kenny Werner’s talk at Google. I have always
          been a really shy person, I don’t really like to make mistakes, make
          people think I don’t know how to do things. This talk really hit me,
          hit my mind with all its power. This talk made me understand that
          there will always be people judging, trying to compete, trying to
          demonstrate how much they know, and that’s also alright, but the thing
          we want to focus on is not letting all these things make us lose our
          will to keep pushing forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming is full of stressful paths that will always make us feel
          we don’t know anything, or at least, that’s how I’ve felt a lot of
          times. But to be honest, I never paid attention to the other side of
          the coin. This feeling is not something bad whatsoever, it is
          something we can learn from. The frustration you have when you don’t
          understand a topic, or when you don’t understand how to solve a
          problem within your code, it is a feeling that can have two outputs,
          walking away, or keep learning. Although every time I have picked to
          keep learning, I always focused on the bad things of it, having the
          fear of having that frustration again. But this talk has made me see
          the real meaning of everything I feel. There is no shame in having
          fear of failing, there is no shame in asking what you don’t know and
          there is nothing wrong in failing even one more time. The only thing
          that actually is a shame, is not trying at all.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          All the documents and videos had similar topics, focused on different
          disciplines, but in the end, it can be applied to every aspect of our
          life. As said in the inner game of tennis, “it’s not about the tennis,
          it’s not about the win or the loss, if we’re here to experience, then
          we are free”, same happens with programming. Most of us (I include
          myself), sometimes think this is a competition, and in some way, it
          is, although it’s not about winning or losing, you need to actually
          enjoy programming, knowing every aspect of it, and not just do it
          because you are required to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week’s readings were focused on getting more confidence about
          myself, and I know that these readings have already made a lot for me.
          Even putting it into practice, the sleeping method has made a little
          bit of improvement. It has helped me not to wake up during the night,
          which is really usual for me. I don’t know if it’s a placebo effect,
          but everything that I learned and did this week has been a roller
          coaster for my mind, and my heart in a good way. And I think my life
          at Encora these months will be the same, which makes me really excited
          about the future, and how my future me will be.{" "}

        <p>
          This week I had the opportunity to participate in a UI Design workshop
          called “Design Sprint”, although a sprint is most of the time 5 days
          of work, we rushed on learning just the most important ideas of a UI
          design sprint in 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meeting, we formed groups of 7+ people which would be our
          design team. The idea was to emulate a real team with a real client
          that was in need for a communication app for their company. We used an
          online workspace tool to make notes and develop the prototype. The
          first step was to brainstorm about what we thought we needed to ask
          the client to gather all the information before we could start
          developing ideas and prototypes. The questions we would ask to the
          client were written by all the team in notes as found in Fig. 1. There
          wasn’t a limit on how many questions we could make, the more, the
          better.
        </p>
        <div className="blog-img">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fZ6wPJA.png" alt="Brainstorm"></img>
        </div>
        <p className="entry-figure">Fig. 1 Brainstorm notes.</p>
        <p>
          After the brainstorm we would emulate a call with a client which was a
          member of another team. We asked him all the questions, and all the
          answers provided would serve us to develop ideas and more questions
          about the product our client would like to get. These new questions
          were called “How Might We”. They were crucial to pinpoint the most
          important features that were needed in our app, here we polished the
          details on how we were going to develop the prototype and let us know
          how to start sketching out ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we had all our information selected, it was time to start the
          prototype development. The online workspace let us select cards that
          were similar to a phone screen. (Fig. 2). Here we made 8 different
          screens for each part of our app, this part of the sprint was called
          Crazy 8. Although it was rough to do it in so little time at the end,
          we could make different designs that were further discussed with the
          client, and all the expectations were met.

        <p className="entry-figure">Fig. 2 Crazy 8 design.</p>
        <p>
          This week I learned a lot about UI design patterns and the most
          typical software to use when we need to work as a team, basically, the
          most important parts or “stages” of a design sprint are the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The team will brainstorm ideas and propose all kind of questions
            which would help to solve the problem we are facing; these will be
            answered by the client.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each member of the team will select and sketch some of the winning
            ideas after the interview with the client, this will let us have
            potential solutions and perspectives on how to start working.
          </li>
          <li>
            A single winning sketch will be selected after a voting session.
            This selected idea needs to be critiqued one more time to polish it
            as close to perfection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prototyping starts in this stage; the selected idea is transformed
            into a realistic prototype.
          </li>
          <li>
            End part of the sprint, here the prototype is reviewed and redone if
            needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Aside from the design sprint, this week we got different coding
          challenges from Google Jam. Five of them were team challenges and we
          got to decide a single problem to solve it by our own. Through the
          week us, the Interns, made two calls to divide the challenges
          depending on everyone’s capabilities and everyone's programming
          languages. All these coding challenges will be further discussed in
          the next week entry, although this week I had a chance to practice
          data structures and algorithms while trying to solve all coding
          challenges on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we were asked to start our own blog. We could use any webpage
          or tool we wanted, so I decided to build my own, which is the one
          where you are reading right now. 😁

              Twisty Little Passages

        <p>
          All of them needed to be made on 4 different programming languages
          which were TypeScript, Kotlin, Dart and Python. To be honest I was
          kind of scared at first, since it would be my first time working with
          Kotlin and Dart. I didn’t have any experience on those two, but at
          least I knew they were similar to Java and I already had been
          practicing that language with the Hyperskill courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we decided to pick any problems we wanted voluntarily in
          any programming language we felt confident in. As I have worked with
          Python the most, I started with the first three problems, which I
          could solve within 1 day. The three of them didn’t require any data
          structure but arrays and just for loops which didn’t involve any
          algorithm in particular, they were really straightforward, so after
          solving them we discussed them in another team call and we decided to
          translate the code to the other 3 programming languages.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem came with the last 2 problems, Chain Reactions and Twisty
          Little Passages. They seemed really intimidating and it was hard to
          visualize what path to take at first, so we agreed on discussing in
          detail what we could do to solve it. After the meeting, I tried
          solving the fourth one with dynamic programming since it was the most
          discussed topic in the meeting, with no luck at all. I was really
          frustrated as there was no luck on passing all the tests provided on
          Google Jam, there were just a few of them correct. At last, we
          discussed these last 2 problems once again and two of my teammates
          were able to successfully explain how to solve them. I was really
          happy to work with them, since there was no judgement, no laughs and
          there were never “dumb” questions, everyone were supportive and we
          learned from each other a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, with all the explanation and feedback we had, I
          volunteered to solve both problems on Dart, since I wanted to test my
          learning capabilities with a whole new syntax. Dart was really similar
          to C# and Java and the thing I struggled the most was type
          declarations, as you need to be specific and watch the types of all
          variables you declare.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          After one whole day of Dart syntax 101 I was able to solve both
          problems, the last one, was trickier since it was more like a
          statistics and probability problem rather than a programming one.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team, we managed to solve all of these problems relatively not
          that slow, but later in the week we got 3 more coding challenges,
          which were:{" "}

          As we already had experience with the last ones, we did basically the
          same steps to solve them, everyone volunteered to solve each of them.
          I worked on the first and last problem. The first one didn’t require a
          specific algorithm to solve, it was straightforward like the ones I
          solved earlier in the week. I worked with Dart to solve it. But again,
          the problem started with the third one as no one could solve it on
          their own. A meeting was held and we discussed possible solutions, and
          after hours of discussion everyone agreed to start researching and
          seek a solution we could study and then implement it with our own
          code. All the solutions and explanations can be further explored here:

          Through the week I also spent an hour a day refreshing my knowledge on
          data structures and algorithms, which was really helpful to not get
          that stressed solving the real Google Jam problems. I re-visited the
          courses available on LeetCode.

          This week was really fulfilling for me, I got to know my teammates
          more and I appreciate so much that everyone is available to teach as
          well as they are not shy to ask if they don’t know something. I got
          the opportunity to learn a lot through teaching Python syntax, data
          structures and algorithms to some of my teammates who reached me after
          getting lost on some coding challenges. This is the first time I tried
          to teach someone else coding and I now I know why people say that the
          best way to fully understand something is to teach people about that
          topic. But I did not only teach people, I had the opportunity to learn
          from my teammates, and again, I was really happy to know everyone was
          open and understanding when everyone did questions. I really felt in a
          safe and confident place.
