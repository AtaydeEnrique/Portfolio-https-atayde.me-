          The first week as an encorian must be one of the most difficult but at
          the same time exciting things I can write about. For me, this means
          the start of a new challenge, since I’m at the start of my
          professional career, so these few days have been like a roller coaster
          inside my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuesday was the most exciting day, we got to meet the people we were
          talking to through emails and text messages at the kickoff meeting.
          Although we didn’t do too much, we were told about how we would be
          working through the week, all the information about our accounts, and
          how to set up the devices we got sent. Last but not least one of the
          things I really enjoyed was meeting all my colleagues and hearing
          their reasons for entering Encora. At the end of the day, we got our
          first assignments, which consisted of two essays and one online
          assessment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second day was the busiest one and the one I was expecting the
          most since the topics seemed really interesting to me. We started with
          the Safe Spaces talk, which let us know about the different
          departments where we are free to ask for help depending on the
          situation if we feel lost, or need something. This is one of the
          reasons I picked Encora, since after reading all the information about
          the company, it is noticeable that the thing they care about the most
          is the wellness of their workers. Then we got the Training Class,
          which was a small talk about the perks and benefits we have with our
          personal email.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the day, I joined the Art of Feedback talk. In this talk
          I felt I became someone else at the of it. This is where I learned the
          most. The talk was about how important it is to always express what
          you think and what you feel with your coworkers and clients in the
          most polite way possible, so things can go smoothly and there are no
          misunderstandings. Moreover, I learnt the real meaning of empathy, and
          how to distinguish it from sympathy. I always struggle differentiating
          these two words since I am someone who is direct when I speak, and I
          always say everything I think is wrong, as well as knowing how to
          recognize when I’m in the wrong. This talk really helped me
          pinpointing how I can improve to better understand people and what
          they need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thursday was the most important day as we discussed security issues
          and working environments at Encora. In the “do and not to do” class we
          discussed the most common ways people get scammed or get their
          information stolen and how to prevent it. The topics were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Social Engineering:</b> Is the way people manage social change
            and regulate the way someone will behave in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Malware:</b> Malicious software that can take control over your
            computer and know every move you make.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Ransomware:</b> Malicious software which will block all access to
            your computer until a fee is paid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phishing:</b> Scam using known trademarks to make you think you
            are being contacted by a well-known company{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Spear Phishing:</b> Personalized phishing where the scammer
            already has sensitive information about you
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Trojans/Macros:</b>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the end, we were instructed on the actions we must take when we are
          presented in a situation like these.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, we got to know the methodologies followed at Encora with
          the “Agile” class. The topics weren't broadly explained although we
          got to know that Agile methodologies are used, such as Scrum, Xtreme
          Programming, KanBan and ScrumBan.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday, we started with a big surprise. We got to use our English
          in the entire meeting called “What is Operational Communication
          anyway...”, I was really shy at first but as the meeting progressed, I
          felt really confident at answering some of the questions that were
          asked. I felt motivated to know that we have a space and people that
          will be focused on spend time with us so we can improve our English as
          better as we can, it is something I never heard of in other places so
          I’m looking forward to be asking for help every time I don’t feel
          confident enough with my skills. Then, we joined the orientation
          class, which basically was an explanation of how life at Encora is,
          the perks of working here and a small talk about the speaker’s
          experience at the company, which made me even more excited at being
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, it was the checkout for the first week. I
          appreciated the format of the presentation as I felt as if I was
          talking to a member of my family. They asked questions normally other
          people wouldn’t care to know, but I felt heard, felt at home. It was
          really fun to hear everyone’s experiences and fun things they did
          throughout the week so I’m really happy and enthusiastic about
          participating next week too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, I completed the online training assessments on the
          weekend. Since they were the same topics we discussed throughout the
          week, this was an amazing opportunity to reinforce the knowledge I
          acquired.

          My second week as an Encora Apprentice was a little bit more relaxed,
          although that doesn’t mean it was easy. We got to use a programming
          learning tool called HyperSkill. There, we got asked to complete a
          Java BackEnd Developer path to get used to this programming language.
          I already had experience with other programming languages such as
          Python, JavaScript and C++, so this has been a really nice refresher
          for me since I got the opportunity to re-learn concepts I forgot over
          the years, and got the opportunity to reassure knowledge that was not
          100% clear before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The platform is really easy to use as it is really intuitive. The way
          it works is by projects, so you can practice everything right after
          you learn it. All the summaries and explanations are clear, and what I
          liked the most is that you get to test the knowledge gained after
          every lecture in an enjoyable way.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were asked to work on a cinema project, which basically was divided
          into 5 sections:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Learning how to print, and basic concepts about the programming
            language.
          </li>
          <li>Syntax.</li>
          <li>Arrays and Loops.</li>
          <li>
            Functional programming (which I learned are called methods in Java).
          </li>
          <li>Error handling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The project asked us to write a program which would let us construct
          our cinema by printing the available seats on the console using
          multidimensional arrays, pricing them according to their position, and
          letting the user pick their seats. At last, we were asked to handle
          every action that would make the program crash, like user made
          mistakes, or wrong calculations that would happen within our code.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from the HyperSkill platform, I attended a couple of meetings
          throughout the week. The first one was “Communication” which I could
          describe as a complement to the meet we had on the next day called
          “Client Introduction”. Both were very similar as they let us
          comprehend that letting people know what you are thinking, what you
          understand from them is the most important part as a developer. You
          always need to have clear all the requirements from your client, and
          not be shy to ask “silly” questions, as sometimes not asking and not
          talking on spot, would lead to a complete loss in the future. Both
          meetings gave us recommendations on how to broaden our communications
          capabilities, and how and who to ask if we encounter problems with
          someone.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The second meeting was the continuing part of “Do and what not to do”
          talk. Here I could learn who to ask if sometime I have the need to ask
          for tools, licenses or software about security such as VPN’s,
          subscriptions to any webpage, etc. In addition, I met people that I
          could ask for help whenever I make a mistake or something that could
          harm the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last meeting of the week was “Opportunity Seagulls”. Here we were
          introduced to the marketing team, which gave us a broad talk about how
          we can contribute to the company by forwarding every potential client
          we meet in our daily life, work meetings, work travels and such to the
          marketing department.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last but not least, this week was a transformation time for me. I can
          start by talking about Kenny Werner’s talk at Google. I have always
          been a really shy person, I don’t really like to make mistakes, make
          people think I don’t know how to do things. This talk really hit me,
          hit my mind with all its power. This talk made me understand that
          there will always be people judging, trying to compete, trying to
          demonstrate how much they know, and that’s also alright, but the thing
          we want to focus on is not letting all these things make us lose our
          will to keep pushing forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming is full of stressful paths that will always make us feel
          we don’t know anything, or at least, that’s how I’ve felt a lot of
          times. But to be honest, I never paid attention to the other side of
          the coin. This feeling is not something bad whatsoever, it is
          something we can learn from. The frustration you have when you don’t
          understand a topic, or when you don’t understand how to solve a
          problem within your code, it is a feeling that can have two outputs,
          walking away, or keep learning. Although every time I have picked to
          keep learning, I always focused on the bad things of it, having the
          fear of having that frustration again. But this talk has made me see
          the real meaning of everything I feel. There is no shame in having
          fear of failing, there is no shame in asking what you don’t know and
          there is nothing wrong in failing even one more time. The only thing
          that actually is a shame, is not trying at all.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          All the documents and videos had similar topics, focused on different
          disciplines, but in the end, it can be applied to every aspect of our
          life. As said in the inner game of tennis, “it’s not about the tennis,
          it’s not about the win or the loss, if we’re here to experience, then
          we are free”, same happens with programming. Most of us (I include
          myself), sometimes think this is a competition, and in some way, it
          is, although it’s not about winning or losing, you need to actually
          enjoy programming, knowing every aspect of it, and not just do it
          because you are required to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This week’s readings were focused on getting more confidence about
          myself, and I know that these readings have already made a lot for me.
          Even putting it into practice, the sleeping method has made a little
          bit of improvement. It has helped me not to wake up during the night,
          which is really usual for me. I don’t know if it’s a placebo effect,
          but everything that I learned and did this week has been a roller
          coaster for my mind, and my heart in a good way. And I think my life
          at Encora these months will be the same, which makes me really excited
          about the future, and how my future me will be.{" "}
